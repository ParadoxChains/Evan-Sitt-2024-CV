\cvevent{Digital Signal Processing Plugin for Multilayered Synthesis}{E\"otv\"os Lor\'and University}{2019-2020 Academic Year}{}
\small{
	This project will implement a DSP plugin, using the Virtual Studio Technology 3 (VST3) interface standard. The project will handle MIDI input and generate a polyphonic multilayered synthesizer waveform via the use of wavetables, combining both additive and subtractive synthesis.The implementation of the project will be accomplished with the use of the JUCE framework. The application will be hosted by any VST3 compatible DAW, or used as a standalone synthesizer application.

\cvevent{Implementation of Digital Synthesis in Functional Programming}{E\"otv\"os Lor\'and University}{2019-2020 Academic Year}{}
\small{Digital synthesis is a cross discipline application used in fields such as music, telecommunication, and others. The nature of digital synthesis involving multiple tracks as well as parallel post-processes lends itself naturally to the functional programming paradigm. The paper demonstrates this by creating a fully functional, cross platform, standalone synthesizer application framework implemented in a pure lazy functional language. The application handles MIDI input and produces wav output played by any multimedia player. Therefore, it can serve as a preprocessor for users who intend to create digital signals before transcribing them into a digital or physical media.}

\cvevent{How to Increase Interest in Studying
Functional Programming
via Interdisciplinary Application}{E\"otv\"os Lor\'and University}{2018-2019 Academic Year}{}
\small{
Functional programming represents a modern tool for applying and implementing software. The state
of the art in functional programming reports an increasing number of methodologies in this paradigm.
However, extensive interdisciplinary applications are missing. Our goal is to increase student interest
in pursuing further studies in functional programming with the use of an application: the ray tracer.
We conducted a teaching experience, with positive results and student feedback, described here in
this paper.
