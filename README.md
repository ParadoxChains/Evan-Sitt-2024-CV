# Evan Sitt Resume 2021 Edition (Goodbye 2020!)
----
Greetings there!\
If you're here, I suppose you were looking for my resume in particular, or you were happening upon one of my repositories.\
Either way, welcome! I hope you will take a glance at my humble resume and find something of interest to you.\
The resume is written in LaTex using a template from Overleaf, with some personalization by yours truly. Feel free to use it, just leave in the annotations for courtesy sake to the original creator of the template.\
Have a very wonderful day!\
\
Cheers!\
-Evan Sitt
